# Awesome-Project
At first, I was hesitant to work in groups because I often work alone at work. 
But after introducing myself and being known to everyone, I started to get more used to talking to people. 
My team is amazing because everyone can come up with so many great ideas and solutions to problems.
What I find difficult is that when everyone has their own ideas and it is difficult to refuse to include those ideas in the project. 
I guess they will feel a bit disappointed when I say that the idea is not suitable. suitable for the project... But anyway, I also learned a lot when working in groups, how to communicate effectively, how to convey ideas into words and how to say "no" to inappropriate ideas. .

Here is our Project
